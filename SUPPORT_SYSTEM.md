   - Use `/newbot` command
   - Follow instructions to create your bot
   - Save the bot token

2. **Create Support Group:**
   - Create a new Telegram group for your support team
   - Add your bot to the group
   - Make the bot an admin (optional but recommended)

3. **Get Chat ID:**
   - Add your bot to the group
   - Send a message to the group
   - Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Find your group's chat ID in the response

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_SUPPORT_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

### 3. Support Dashboard Access

- **URL:** `/support`
- **Username:** `support`
- **Password:** `grant2024`

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User clicks the floating chat button
2. Enters name and email
3. Types their support question
4. Message is stored and Telegram notification sent
5. User receives confirmation that support will respond

### 2. Support Team Flow
1. Receives Telegram notification with user details and message
2. Logs into support dashboard at `/support`
3. Views message list and selects user to respond to
4. Types response in the dashboard
5. Response is recorded (in production, would be sent to user)

### 3. Telegram Notification Format
```
